	hr
	p Responsive slideshow is not only the most basic but also the most important element in web development. This module offers a slideshow with fully responsive design. Also, a few options can be handled by data attributes, such as 'data-period', 'data-btn-bar', and 'data-arr-bar'. These will give a user an ability to choose period of the slideshow or to enable / disable a button bar or arrow buttons to navigate over the slideshows.
